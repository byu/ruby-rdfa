#A Change Log for versions of Ruby-RDFa

= 2007 April 07, r7 =

  * Added support for RDFa Nested Structures. That is, xml elements that have a rel or rev without an href attribute.

= 2007 March 14, r6 =

  * Initial import of code. With limitations:
    # xml:base is completely ignored.
    # Ignores Reification, but will output anonymous nodes in a special way.
    # The RDFa Specification is still in flux, so please bear with.
    # Nest CURIEs are not supported.
    # Literal text are the only supported object datatype (as the content) for RDFa property statements; xml fragments are converted to a string.
